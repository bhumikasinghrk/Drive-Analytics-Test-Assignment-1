# Drive-Analytics-Test-Assignment-1


There are 2 image files here. One is a jpeg and the other is a png. 

What this notebook does:
1) automatically check for their dimensions, and 
2) both the images are placed at the center of square image of 1024x1024 each
3) stacked horizontally, so that you get an output of H x W (1024 x 2048) image 
4) output is a png file 
5) transparency of the original png is maintained.
